                <p style="margin-top: 3%;font-size: 1.2vw;">Lolita Fashion is a kind of dressing style which is become more and more popular, but it is also a style that not all of the others can accept. Many girls have
                    receive some bad comments after they post their pictures of wearing lolita on weibo or some other social software. I have heard many girls around worried about
                    whether to share their pictures to the person who like this style because they may be criticalized by someone who do not understand.Also, the dresses are often
                    sold online which means you cannot try before you buy.</p>
